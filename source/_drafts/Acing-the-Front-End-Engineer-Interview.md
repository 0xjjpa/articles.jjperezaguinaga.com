**#Introduction**

In my past article about the Web Development Landscape for 2014, I described that the title "Front End Engineer" was becoming not only popular, but an actual job description people were already interviewing for it. In today's article, I'll share my own personal tips for Front End job hunting, how to prepare a Front End job application, and how to be ready for when the interview comes.

#Front End Job Hunting

##**Know the job**

The first piece of advice I give to my friends looking for a job is to **know the job**. What are the responsibilities of a Front End Engineer? Since it a somewhat new term, people have different definitions:

[List of Definitions]

If you are applying for a Front End Engineering job, you need to make sure which of those definitions fit your own profile. After you had that settled, look for a job whose Front End job description resembles the one you had defined for yourself. The truth is that even if a company publishes a Front End job, its description might not be the same kind of Front End job you think it is; for instance, as an example (Flash), (mobile), (javascript)

##Learn to distinguish bad Front End Jobs from good ones

This is harder said than done, but after reading a few job descriptions, it gets easier to spot the ones that probably just renamed "PSD slicer" to Front End Engineer because it sounds nicer:

* Lack of buzzwords.

* Excess of buzzwords.

* Fail to "geek out".
