If you remember my last [post](http://jjperezaguinaga.wordpress.com/2012/03/16/improving-the-aiesec-tn-lookup-portal-javascript/ "Quick and Dirty script"), I was creating a small script in order to improve the performance of the MyAIESEC.net portal. I was complaining about the popups (I still do, I think there should be a specific place in hell for people that still code using pop-ups) and how the overall user experience was sort of poor, since it doesn't let you filter almost nothing and navegability is well, just bad.
