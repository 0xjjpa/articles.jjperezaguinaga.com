Ever since I started coding in PHP (about 5 years ago), I always looked up for ways to speed up my development. From IDE's to snippets, anything that could help me out was good.

After a while, I started to see a pattern in most of my applications. Good programming practices were starting to fill in me and then, funny enough, I found the MVC design pattern. After that, everything just started to make sense. I started to use a framework a friend made based in MVC and some actually nice web applications were born.

And then CodeIgniter appeared.

You know, I liked my friend's framework and all that, but it was supported by... him. CodeIgniter showed a really strong community, was quite easier to handle and had some libraries already loaded and ready to use. Long story short, after a using CodeIgniter for over a year now, I'm quite happy that I picked CodeIgniter over other frameworks around; there's now even a CMS based in CodeIgniter I support every once in a while ([PyroCMS](http://pyrocms.com/ "PyroCMS"), give it a look).

I picked CodeIgniter over Symfony because it's dead simple to install. Download, paste in web root, modify application/config.php and boom, up and running.

I picked CodeIgniter over Zend  because it's light weight. I don't need an infinite amount of libraries or helpers I don't need, I just want a simple portable solution.

I picked CodeIgniter over CakePHP because the last time I tried it (I don't even remember), the templating system was... mah. CodeIgniter has dead simple Template Parser that just works. I mix it with [Mustache.js](http://mustache.github.com/ "Mustache") and well, what can I say?

If I already convinced you, then give it a try and start learning it. [Jorge Torres](http://www.jotorres.com) put a nice [intro](http://www.jotorres.com/2011/11/codeigniter-for-the-absolute-beginner/) for CodeIgniter beginners that I bet you guys would like to read. After you read that, dig into Net Tuts Plus series of [CodeIgniter From Scratch](http://net.tutsplus.com/sessions/codeigniter-from-scratch/ "CodeIgniter from Scratch"). You'll be coding apps in no time.
