Over the last few months I had been working with a multiple range of technologies that range from the usual Front End Stack ([Angular.js 2.0](https://angular.io/), [React.js](http://facebook.github.io/react/), [Gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com/), [Browserify](http://browserify.org/)), to a more Backend-ish area type ([Nginx](http://nginx.org/en/), [Lua](http://www.lua.org/), [Python](https://www.python.org/)).

During that journey, I stumbled upon [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), and started using it for my entire development workflow. After using it actively for a few months, I've increased my own personal productivity as a Front End Engineer, and allowed me to finalize take full control of the entire Web Application deployment cycle.
