_After not writing for about 2, 3 months? I finally have some time back! I moved in to Switzerland so that took some time. Want some chocolate?_

About 6 years ago I started my first software project: It was a simple graphic calculator made in Java. As part of my Computer Science course, I was required to write the documentation, use cases and tests for the project. Even though I got a good grade, I'll tell you right now: I had no idea what I was doing (Don't tell my teacher).

I'm not talking about the specific activities; of course I understood what a Use Case meant, what was a Test Case and most of the classics UML Diagrams (Class Diagram, Sequence Diagram, Communication, Deployment, jargon jargon). That didn't mean I knew **why** those those activities were required, because my young mind was barely grasping the concept of **Software Development.** I thought that all this things were part of a Lego world that if assembled together, would happily create a house.

Like that ever happens.

I have read [Code Complete 2](http://www.cc2e.com/Default.aspx "Code Complete") multiple times at different stages of my career. Even today, the best analogy I find for developing software is building a house, not because they do resemble, but because both are equally complex and change most of the time. What I find funny, is that usually dead simple houses don't go as messed up as dead simple [software](http://www.projectcartoon.com/cartoon/1 "How projects are"). Why is this?

**The Prototype Effect**

Unlike with Software, you can see pretty much everything is going on with your house. If you kick a weak wall, it's probably going to break. If you see something you don't like, you will speak up. If you change your mind about a specific thing, you will think FIRST about how much that's going to cost you and then tell the architect about the changes, after carefully considering the damage to your wallet due your lack of taste.

On Software Prototypes, most of the time we protect ourselves as customers to show progress, because we want to get paid. And sadly, most of the time we just get paid when **we get things done**. Planning? -That's for granted right?. Data Modeling? -Are you speaking english here?

Once a Software Engineer told me about what he described as the Prototype Effect. He described it as "unrealistic expectations given by a stupid developer coming from the stupid idea that the software will be released on time" (it most likely had more foul language in it, but I'll skip that). In his words, showing a Prototype was the worst idea ever, and the least you show a customer a working version before release, the better, because in his mind "customers don't even know what they want anyway, and they will reject or accept your software based in feeling more than the requirements provided".

_To be fair, this guy has taken a good toll of [clients from hell](http://clientsfromhell.net/ "Client from Hell"). _

I disagree, but I can't blame him. He, the same way as I, come from the Rational Unified Process developer process, where we craft big iterations to show our customers/clients, hoping that the effort was worth the cost.

**Going down to the point: SCRUM**

On my opinion, RUP is broken as hell (ooooh the rage). It's based on the assumption that you have a skilled team of developers with equally skills equally aware of the project with the equal commitment and perspective, been able to turn in a big iteration based on big process that receive almost no feedback until the end of the "iteration", which depending on your process, can take up to a month.

I spent so much time planning my projects instead of getting the actual job _done_. Even though I finished most of my projects, I always spent  extra hours finishing the details because I just _didn't work enough_, and most of my time was spent on planning.

Yes, I could had planned better, but I'm still learning. (Estimating a project is an _ART)_

Yes, I could had managed my relationship with my customer better, but wearing all the hats is tiring.

No, I was not expecting that the client would come up with requirements at the very last.

So what was my alternative? SCRUM and XP.

SCRUM is an agile development methodology. It comes from  saying "we won't try to understand all the complex ramifications of your project and get work on them instead. We will deal with those as they come". It's about making the user SEE in small iterations (Sprints) what he or she is getting. It has a project manager (Scrum Leader) that handles the business relationship with the customer and sets up the features to be deployed (BackLog) in the shape of simple sentences (Stories) instead of long tiring use cases.

XP is also an agile development methodoloy, which resembles SCRUM in many ways, but depending in how you learn it may have or not a Project Leader. It also uses small iterations (Timeboxing) but it drops most of the other jargon to only fit the basic acceptance-code-test cycle. It can be mixed with strong Test Driven Methodologies (Test Driven, Behavior Driven) and is used commonly in Hack@tons or BarCamps to deploy as many features as possible. Sometimes it will be used to just create new ideas or to see the skills on a team.

For me, both methodologies had provided me the best results in delivering projects. Sadly, I could only apply it a little to late in my last project which ended up in not been finished as I would had expected. In the other hand, for me it's a good way to make clients and customers feel how the project is rolling. I won't surprise you with a full complete house, neither make you expectations boxing myself from scenarios that will break for sure. Instead, together we develop your software.
