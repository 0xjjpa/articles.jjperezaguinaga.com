_This post is a part of series that I want to create about some programming communities I had been in, my experience on them, pros and cons. Feel free to share your experience with such communities._

Unlike with Experts Exchange (whose story I describe [here](http://jjperezaguinaga.wordpress.com/2011/12/05/programming-communities-part-1-experts-exchange/ "Programming Communities Part 1: Experts Exchange")), [Forrst ](http://forrst.com "Forrst")is a closed developers/designers community where instead of having to pay to get answers, you have to actually contribute and then either get approval from the community or get invited by someone else. In my case, I made a couple comments there and about three weeks later I got the invite to the site.

Is it worth all this procedures to get it? Hell it is.

You see, by being closed and letting the community filter the members that are allowed to go in, you are ensuring the quality of the content. I had been there for about 2 or 3 months and sometimes I'm just amazed at the designs and scripts posted there. What's the drill on Forrst?

**Get feedback**

Probably the best thing about Forrst is that you get feedback from all kind of skillful persons that give insightful and meaningful, honest feedback. You can see how a project is growing up by comments of the community members, and at the same time get pointers on specific matters. There are all kind of experts there that will happily tell you when you are messing things up (in a polite way), and advice you how not to do so anymore. Forrst is the first place I go to try an idea: I see how many people seem interested, amused about the idea or think that it's good at all (or not). Thanks to Forrst feedback and its valued community, I had saved time that I would had otherwise wasted on developing a fruitless idea.

**Announce projects**

If you have created a new application and need some quality beta testers, there's no better way to get them on Forrst. Forrst even has a internal mechanism of promoting posts, allowing you to get impressions on the main feed of posts, where you display your project to ask people to try it or provide feedback. This service costs, but if you are a support member, you can use this for free once each month (although, of course, being a supporter costs too, but the feeling is different than paying a membership). I had tested (and broked ;) some applications that some day will see the light of the web.

**Networking**

This may not be an explicit feature of Forrst (you can follow people of course, but there's no such a thing as friends or networks), but on Forrst you get to know a lot of really skillful people  (if you contribute of course). If I ever need a design on an application that I want to launch, where do you think I'm going to look up first? I have seen the work of those persons, their attitude on positive and negative feedback and of course, what are they made of. You can also find there partners for your new big thing, or even a small script that you wanted to create but didn't find the right person with the right focus.

In conclusion, I define Forrst as a **warming community made of young and experienced fearless designers and developers, where sharing feedback, announcing products and create new friends is possible if you have what it takes to be there**.
