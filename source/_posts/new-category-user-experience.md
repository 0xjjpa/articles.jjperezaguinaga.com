Last winter I did an exchange program at [UBC](http://www.ubc.ca/ "University of British Columbia") (University of British Columbia) in Vancouver, Canada, where I had outstanding classes from probably the most skilled teachers around the BC Area.

One of my favorite classes was HCI (Human Computer Interaction), given by [Karon MacLean](http://people.cs.ubc.ca/~maclean/ "Karon MacLean"), Member of the [Graphics Visualization Human Centered Technologies Department](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/imager/imager.php "GVHCI"). Ever since then, I found the structure to glue my Front End Engineering skills with Human Computer Interaction practices, which gave as a result 2 open source projects that I will be showcasing in the following days.

In order to do so, I'm creating a new category in my blog: User Experience. For this category I'm planning to focus in the development of proper user centered designs when developing software, as well as to strategies for interface design best-practices. It's important to notice that User Experience is just a branch of Human Computer Interaction,  but since my professional career focuses in web development, I will describe only the HCI topics relevant to UX.

In case you are curious about the basic concepts for HCI or other practices and strategies for User Centered Design, feel free to browse the course material, which as of today is still available in the[ course website](http://www.ugrad.cs.ubc.ca/~cs344/current-term/index.html "UBC 314 HCI Introduction").
