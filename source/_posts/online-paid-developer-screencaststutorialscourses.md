# Description

I'm listing premium sites that describe the latest technologies, mainly aimed for web engineers, front end engineers, mobile developers, back end engineers, OSX/iOSX, devOps practices, CI, BDD/TDD and system administrators.

I'm thinking in updating this every once in a while, so I'll be creating a Gist [here](https://gist.github.com/4120163 "Gist") with this article code, so please feel free to drop in some suggestions and I'll update it in Coderwall.

I have purchased in some of their content, but I'll refrain to write a review until I tried them all. I won't neither list prices or rating, as probably the amount of courses I have don't represent a good sample.

Finally, I'm in no way related to any of those, but I would like other companies to share their employees training programs (if any) or resources provided as perks and which of the following they use.
