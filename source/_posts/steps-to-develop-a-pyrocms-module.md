I know I haven't wrote much in the last days, but I had been really busy at job; my current project is to develop a module for contractors within the company ([GPSI](gpsi-intl.com)), so they can update required information. I had been doing it with PyroCMS, and after reading the [Docs](http://www.pyrocms.com/docs) I decided to create a diagram that will help me out for the next time I'm in doubt.

I also created a template base module, which you can browse [here](http://www.box.com/s/glxgd8lbz88rrejgz29g "Box Net PyroCMS repo")Â (boxnet) or from my box.net right next in the sidebar. It's pretty much the galleries template stripped of all not required stuff. You may see some database logic (the one I'm using for my project) but feel free to remove it (I left it there as an example).

PyroCMS v2.0 Release Candidate 1 is up! Read more [here](http://www.pyrocms.com/blog/2011/12/pyrocms-v20-release-candidate "PyroCMS RC1").

**Update:** Feel free to share, copy and edit the diagram. If you want the Adobe Illustrator file, just drop me an email.
