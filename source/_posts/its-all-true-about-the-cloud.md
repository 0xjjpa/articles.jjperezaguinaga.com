I had been moving a lot to cloud solutions lately. Yes, I have my own server and yes, I enjoy twiching and playing with it once in a while, I just think that it's just not enough anymore. Why? Because a server has its limitations.

Don't get me wrong, my server and I have a really close relationship; it taught me about web development, sysadmin, security and multiple programming languages. But it's just too much information to deal with. As a developer, I want to have control of everything, and a server is just not enough. Portfolios, files and projects are all chunked there, and it's hitting it's performance in a really sadistic way. For the last weeks I had been getting more and more Internal Server Errors that are just the consequence of having about 6 wordpress instalations on it, 3 CodeIgniter instances and who knows what. It's my file sharing server and playground too.

So instead of hosting my files, I moved to Box.net; I can share files there to my Linked In account and any visitor that stumbles upon my profile; instead of making it host yet another Wordpress install, I will just use wordpress.com hosting service. Instead of having to host my projects, I'll ask Github do it for me (the open source ones) and Xp-Dev.com (the private ones). Back up is managed by BackBlaze. Articles that I wrote will be hosted in Experts Exchange.

Finally my server will have a break; heck, maybe I won't need it anymore! The cloud is actually a really good alternative.
