Please. If you consider yourself an average developer, interested in getting, you know, something like a job, open your Linked In account NOW. I advice almost all my peers to do so and there's still a few that don't get the clue.

Here's a few reasons why you MUST open a Linked In account:

1.  **It's actually useful for your professional life: **Facebook, Google+ and Twitter are cute, but they won't help you get a job. Yeah, maybe you will get a contact or an opening, but not an interview, that's for sure. Linked In will, at least it has done it for me. I had gotten a couple of interviews thanks to my profile, and
2.  **You can look up to someone: **I think I'm in the place I am thanks to the people that has been teaching me all the way. I know that I still have a long way, but I consider myself now a decent developer. If I wouldn't have someone to look up to, then maybe I wouldn't have a roadmap to follow. When you see your role model as a Microsoft Software Developer or National Instruments Research Developer, then you know it's good to follow your steps.
3.  **Good structure for a resume: **If you have no idea how to create a resume, hint, Linked In knows. Just start putting whatever it asks you to, and export it in a handy resume. Related to point 2, if you don't have anything to fill in, well, start doing something! It just helps you with the "what" to do.
If you open a Linked In account, I would love to have you as a connection (if I know you). Send me an invite at jj.perez.aguinaga@hotmail.com.
