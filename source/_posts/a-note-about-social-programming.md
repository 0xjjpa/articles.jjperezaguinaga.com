I'm not an expert, but I would define social programming as a **strategy to develop an application that gets input from multiple persons**. In plain english, you code something most of the time open source, that can be easily seen by many people which then give feedback. I'll mention some advantages of social programming, as well as some sites that you should start looking... like now.

**Advantages**

1.  **Puts your feet in the ground: **So you think you are a good developer? Check Paul Irish ([http://paulirish.com/](http://paulirish.com/)), Shi Chuan ([http://www.blog.highub.com/](http://www.blog.highub.com/)), Mathias Bynens ([http://mathiasbynens.be/](http://mathiasbynens.be/)) and Nicolas Gallagher ([http://nicolasgallagher.com/](http://nicolasgallagher.com/)) code examples. How did I found this amazing guys? Well, I followed the Paul Irish jQuery repo in github ([https://github.com/jquery](https://github.com/jquery)), then boilerplate html5 ([http://html5boilerplate.com/](http://html5boilerplate.com/)) and then I realized I had no idea at all about javascript. Go figure.
2.  **You actually get input**: Web Development, for instance, is a sort of new career around town. 20 years (max) is nothing, compared with professions that had been going on during a century. There are not definitive rules how to learn Web Development, and it just involves too many things (i.e. SEO, Javacript, HTML, back-end programming, sysadmin). Chances are that you can get an advice or two from someone that has a little bit more experience than you do.
3.  **You can ease your life by using someone else's code:** Think about it, the problem you are trying to solve now it's probably one that was already faced by someone else. Why reinvent the wheel? Of course it's important to learn, but no point in wasting your time.
**Places to go social programming**

If I could name a couple of activities that include social programming, I would say **get involved in a programming community, fork and watch other people projects and write and share code with other people.** I'll provide you some sites where I have been starting to do so.

1.  **ExpertsExchange (www.experts-exchange.com): **There's a lot of hate to those guys because premium service is required in order to get the answers. Well, then start answering questions! Many people don't know, but you can get access to all their knowledge base by just answering other's people questions. Some questions range from really easy to complex stuff that real Experts struggle. I had been there for a couple years and I have to admit that I love the community feeling there, and I have a couple of fellows that I know for sure can solve any question about an specific topic. (For instance, I follow Ray Paseur ([http://www.experts-exchange.com/M_3774417.html](http://www.experts-exchange.com/M_3774417.html)), a PHP rockstar). I'm just starting to try Forrst and StackOverflow, so I'll keep you updated on those fellas.
2.  **Github (github.com): **Personally, I don't know how I could ever code a line without knowing Github. Not only provides Source Version Control, but also the ability to watch and fork projects from other people (and of course, from your projects too).
3.  **Snipplr (snipplr.com) and JsFiddle (jsfiddle.net): **I'm running out of time, so I'll break it for you: Snipplr, write a code, store it there, share it, reuse (do the same with other's people code). Jsfiddle, javascript playground; maybe it doesn't have the watch/sharing functionality by default, but you can save up a link and share it by your own means, and get input from it. It's a nice mix between testing and sharing.
That's all for today, I should start studying. Important Project Management examen tomorrow. Wish me luck!
