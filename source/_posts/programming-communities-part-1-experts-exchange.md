_This post is a part of series that I want to create about some programming communities I had been in, my experience on them, pros and cons. Feel free to share your experience with such communities._

My story with Experts Exchange starts about 2 years ago; as many of you, I was looking for an answer to a simple question and when googling it, Experts Exchange almost-literal-question was there just a click away to show me the answer. Or so I thought. If you had ever clicked a link to an Experts Exchange question, then you know that in order to get access to the question you either a) pay for it b) answer other questions. Many people complain about this because it's a way to restrict knowledge and making a business about it.

Personally, I really like it.

Don't get me wrong, I love other communities like Stack Overflow (I'll talk about that one in the next post) where information is just right away to your reach. However, I think Experts Exchange style prompts users into actually give something before getting the answer.  Yes, that should be a programmer's duty after getting new knowledge but most of the time people won't do anything. Many peers just google, get a solution, solve the problem, without never, ever writing a tutorial for the next person to make it easier. Since sometimes I need extra motivation to not be part of that group of selfish programmers, I found that EE monthly reminders of "drop by and answer some question to maintain Premium status" actually encouraged me to be part of the community. They gave to me, and I gave back.

Other thing that makes me like Experts Exchange is that there's room for newbies. Even though I consider myself an intermediate computer programmer, I know I still have a long way to go; 2 years ago that path was even larger, and thanks to EE I was able to start browsing questions and answering them because some of them were really easy; since most of the time my answer was not 100% accurate, it was just a matter of time before other people whose answers were way better would show up. By answering questions, I was increasing my confidence in my programming skills and able to provide applied knowledge to people's needs. You didn't need to be a brainiac to help other people as long as you have the interest and attitude to solve a problem.

The next feature (which I just realized a couple weeks ago) that increased my love for EE was the articles and blogging platform. The internet is what it is right now thanks to the sum of knowledge provided by all kinds of people; however, sometimes is really hard to get a platform that allows you to share said knowledge in an easy way (or like me, you get all obsessed about security, performance, design, that you just lose any motivation whatsoever). EE changes that by letting you write a blog starting by filling two text fields; the articles are reviewed by moderators with years of experience, ensuring the quality of the content.

Summing up, my favorite parts of EE are the **get and give feeling, newbie friendly environment and publishing platform.** I also love the incredible amount of good experts there, but I think each community has its own heroes, so it was not worthy describing.

If I couldn't convince to give it a try, then at least don't be part of the community of developers that complain about EE (I'm looking at you, [Experts Exchange Sucks](http://experts-exchange-sucks.com/ "EE doesn")). I had learned an interesting amount of knowledge thanks to the actual experts there, and I wouldn't want that to go away. Go EE!
